# AttendanceListGrader
## Project Summary
This project takes in 3 text files, the **grademail.txt** (contains a list of student usernames), the **atmail.txt** (contains a list of students emails) and **gardes.txt** (contais a list of students grades from one to many weeks).

The program formats the students attendance emails and grades to match the order of the grademail user names so that that list produced in comeplete.txt can be be exported to the excel file that is uploaded to canvas

## Instructions for Use
The actual program it self uses real data from spread sheets pulled from Canvas, for FERPA purposes **randomUsrGen** generates a list of fake user names and emails in the same format that temple uses.
